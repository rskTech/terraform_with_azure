## ðŸ§© Best Practices in Terraform Provider Development

Developing Terraform providers involves writing Go code to integrate Terraform with external APIs or systems. Following best practices ensures that your provider remains modular, maintainable, and easy to extend.

### ðŸ“˜ 1. Separate Resource Code from API Interactions
Why this matters

Mixing Terraform resource logic with API interaction code leads to tightly coupled components, making it hard to:

- Maintain or update provider logic.

- Switch to newer API versions.

- Write meaningful unit tests.

Best Practice

- Keep resource handling and API communication in different packages or files.

Example Structure
```
terraform-provider-example/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ main.go
â”œâ”€â”€ provider.go
â”œâ”€â”€ resource_user.go         # Terraform resource logic
â””â”€â”€ api/
    â”œâ”€â”€ client.go            # API client logic
    â”œâ”€â”€ user_api.go          # Functions for User API operations
    â””â”€â”€ models.go            # Structs for API payloads

```

### ðŸ§  2. Abstract API Logic for Easier Updates
Why this matters

API specifications can change â€” endpoints, authentication, or payload formats. Abstracting API interactions allows:

- Quick adaptation to new API versions.

- Reduced code changes in Terraform resource logic.

- Easier unit testing and mocking.

Best Practice
- Encapsulate all API calls within an abstraction layer â€” Terraform resources should only call high-level API methods, not handle raw HTTP
