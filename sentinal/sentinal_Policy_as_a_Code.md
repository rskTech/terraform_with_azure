## üõ°Ô∏è Introduction to Sentinel for Policy Management

Sentinel is HashiCorp‚Äôs Policy as Code (PaC) framework used to enforce fine-grained, logic-based policies across the Terraform ecosystem.
It allows organizations to define governance rules that control what infrastructure changes can be made, ensuring security, compliance, and operational consistency.

### üìò 1. Overview of Policy as Code
What is Policy as Code?

Policy as Code (PaC) is the practice of writing and managing organizational rules and compliance policies in code form ‚Äî similar to how you write application or infrastructure code.

Instead of manual approvals or spreadsheets, PaC automates:

Security validation (e.g., ensure encryption enabled)

Compliance enforcement (e.g., tagging standards)

Cost governance (e.g., restrict large VM sizes)

Sentinel allows these rules to be version-controlled, tested, and integrated directly into CI/CD pipelines.

### Sentinel Policy Lifecycle
| Stage       | Description                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Define**  | Write Sentinel policy rules as `.sentinel` files            |
| **Test**    | Validate policies with test cases before enforcement        |
| **Enforce** | Attach policies to workspaces in Terraform Cloud/Enterprise |
| **Monitor** | Track compliance and violations in dashboards               |
```
# restrict_vm_size.sentinel
# Ensure no large instance sizes are used in Terraform plans

import "tfplan"

main = rule {
    all tfplan.resources.aws_instance as _, instances {
        all instances as _, instance {
            instance.applied.instance_type in ["t2.micro", "t3.small", "t3.medium"]
        }
    }
}

```
üß† Explanation:

The policy loads Terraform plan data (tfplan import).

It loops through all EC2 instances and checks their type.

Any disallowed instance type will cause the policy to fail.

### Policy Enforcement Levels
| Enforcement Mode   | Behavior                               |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Advisory**       | Warns but allows the run to continue   |
| **Soft Mandatory** | Fails the run, but admins can override |
| **Hard Mandatory** | Fails the run, no override allowed     |

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. How Policies Affect Provider Permissions and Resource Management

Sentinel can restrict or allow Terraform provider actions at a fine-grained level.
This ensures users deploy only approved resources or configurations.

### A. Controlling Provider Permissions

You can use Sentinel to limit which Terraform provider or specific resource types can be used.

Example: Restrict Provider Usage
```
# disallow_unapproved_provider.sentinel
import "tfconfig"

main = rule {
    all tfconfig.providers as name, _ {
        name in ["hashicorp/azurerm", "hashicorp/aws"]
    }
}

```
‚úÖ Explanation:

Only the azurerm and aws providers are allowed.

If someone tries to use google or kubernetes, the plan fails.

### B. Managing Resource Permissions

Sentinel can also control resource creation, such as enforcing:

Storage accounts must have encryption.

VMs must belong to specific resource groups.

Example: Enforce Resource Group Naming Convention (Azure)
```
# enforce_rg_naming.sentinel
import "tfplan"

main = rule {
    all tfplan.resources.azurerm_resource_group as _, rgs {
        all rgs as _, rg {
            startswith(rg.applied.name, "student-")
        }
    }
}
```

üí° Explanation:

Ensures all resource groups created in Azure start with student-.

Perfect for training environments where each student gets isolated resources.

## üß± 3. Best Implementation of Provider-Focused Policies

Implementing Sentinel policies effectively involves integrating them into your Terraform workflow in a structured, scalable way.

### Step 1: Organize Policy Repositories

Maintain a centralized policy repository such as:
```
/sentinel-policies/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ restrict_vm_size.sentinel
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ enforce_rg_naming.sentinel
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ disallow_unapproved_provider.sentinel
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ restrict_vm_size_test.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ enforce_rg_naming_test.json

```
This helps reuse and version policies across multiple teams and projects.

### Step 2: Integrate with Terraform Cloud or Enterprise

In Terraform Cloud/Enterprise, Sentinel runs automatically during:

Plan phase

Apply phase

You can assign policies to:

Organizations

Workspaces

For example:

Allow only azurerm provider for student workspaces.

Enforce tagging or cost limits for production workspaces.

### Step 3: Use Mock Data for Testing

Before enforcing, always test policies using mock data.
```
sentinel test restrict_vm_size.sentinel


‚úÖ Sample Test File (restrict_vm_size_test.json)

{
  "mock": {
    "tfplan": {
      "resources": {
        "aws_instance": {
          "web": {
            "applied": { "instance_type": "t2.micro" }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "test": {
    "main": true
  }
}
```
### Step 4: Policy Versioning and Review

Store policies in Git for code reviews and traceability.

Enforce semantic versioning (v1.0.0, v1.1.0, etc.)

Use CI/CD to validate policies automatically.

### Step 5: Align with Organizational Roles

Admins define and maintain global policies.

Developers focus on resource implementation.

Security Teams ensure policies align with compliance frameworks (ISO, CIS, etc.).

## üöÄ Example: Complete Sentinel Policy for Azure Training Lab

Here‚Äôs a combined example ensuring each student:

Uses only allowed providers.

Creates resource groups with proper names.

Does not exceed VM size limits.
```
import "tfconfig"
import "tfplan"

# Allow only azurerm provider
allowed_providers = ["hashicorp/azurerm"]

provider_check = rule {
    all tfconfig.providers as name, _ {
        name in allowed_providers
    }
}

# Ensure RG name starts with 'student-'
rg_check = rule {
    all tfplan.resources.azurerm_resource_group as _, rgs {
        all rgs as _, rg {
            startswith(rg.applied.name, "student-")
        }
    }
}

# Allow only small VM sizes
vm_check = rule {
    all tfplan.resources.azurerm_linux_virtual_machine as _, vms {
        all vms as _, vm {
            vm.applied.size in ["Standard_B1s", "Standard_B2s"]
        }
    }
}

main = rule { provider_check and rg_check and vm_check }
```

Prevent misconfigurations.

Limit resource creation scope.

Streamline governance for multi-user or multi-student setups.
